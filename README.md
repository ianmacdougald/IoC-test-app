# IoC Test App

This application tests the functionality of an IoC container package I wrote, which is can be found [here](https://github.com/ianmacdougald/IoCjs).

## Getting started

Install Node dependencies (or Node itself)

`npm i`

Then run the following to spin up the server:

`npm start`

Finally, visit http://localhost:3000 to see the page
